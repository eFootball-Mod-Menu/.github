## Overview

The **eFootball Mod Menu** is a comprehensive **single-player gameplay customization framework** built for offline modes.
It offers real-time tuning of player attributes, match physics, AI behavior, skill timing, and progression systems.
Unlike a trainer, the mod menu supports:

* modular categories
* toggles + sliders + value editors
* preset profiles
* plugin extensions
* dynamic real-time injection

The result is a powerful, flexible system that lets you sculpt the perfect match.

[!WARNING]
Never use mod menus in **online** or ranked modes.
This tool is strictly for offline play.
